<p>I am currently working on a pet project in Rails that uses Mongoid to connect as its Object-Document-Mapper (which is similar to what Active Record does for SQL databases).</p>
<p>I then ran into issue when I had an RSpec test case that verified that tested a method that called <a href="http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/querying.html">find_or_create_by</a>. In other words, a record should be created if it did not exist, otherwise the existing record should be returned.</p>
So my test case looked something like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
it 'creates entry from auth hash' do
  auth_hash = {'info' => {'name' =>  'Samuel Vimes'} }
  expect {
    User.find_or_create_from_auth_hash(auth_hash)
  }.to change(User, :count).by(1)
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This test was green the first time I ran it, but failed the second time. The reason was that the database was not being cleaned up in between test runs.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner" title="Database Cleaner">Database Cleaner</a> by <a href="https://github.com/bmabey">Ben Mabey</a> to the rescue. I added this to the :test group of my Gemfile:<br />
{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'database_cleaner', :github => 'bmabey/database_cleaner'
{% endhighlight %}

And this to the configure block of my spec_helper:
{% highlight ruby %}
# Cleanup the DB in between test runs
config.before(:suite) do
  DatabaseCleaner[:mongoid].strategy = :truncation
  DatabaseCleaner[:mongoid].clean_with(:truncation)
end

config.before(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.start
end

config.after(:each) do
  DatabaseCleaner.clean
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And whoila! Now my test passes in every run.</p>
