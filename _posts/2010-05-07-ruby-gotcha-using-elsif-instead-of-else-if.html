<p>These past few days I've been playing with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. I'm really loving the experience so far, but every now and then I stumble upon something that doesn't work as I expected it to.</p>
<p>Last night I encountered problems with one of the most fundamental expressions, namely a if-then-else construct. The interpreter kept complaining that it expected the <strong>end</strong> keyword, but did not find it.</p>
<p>My code was similar to the sample code below:</p>
<div>
{% highlight ruby %}
if 2 == 3
  puts "foo"
else if 3 == 3
  puts "bar"
end
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>Executing this yields an error: [cc]5: syntax error, unexpected $end, expecting kEND[/cc]</p>
<p>At first I was a bit confused and tried to put an extra <strong>end</strong> keyword after the other one, just to see if it would work:</p>
<div>
{% highlight ruby %}
if 2 == 3
  puts "foo"
else if 3 == 3
  puts "bar"
end end
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>This "fixed" the problem. However this solution is not going to win any awards for elegance, so I dug around to see why the original code did not work. The reason is that I <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/syntax.html#if">should have used</a> the <strong>elsif</strong> keyword which is not equivalent of an <strong>if</strong> followed  by an <strong>else</strong> clause. </p>
<div>
{% highlight ruby %}
if 2 == 3
  puts "foo"
elsif 3 == 3
  puts "bar"
end
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<p>The reason why my original implementation did not work, and why adding an extra <strong>end</strong> worked becomes much more obvious if we change the indentation of the original example:</p>
<div>
{% highlight ruby %}
if 2 == 3
  puts "foo"
else
  if 3 == 3
    puts "bar"
  # Missing end here!
end
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
