<p>Using console.log statements in your Javascript code can <a href="http://theablefew.com/blog/internet-explorer-and-console-log">break behaviour in Internet Explorer</a>, including version 9 of that browser.</p>
<p>I just got burned by this.</p>
<p>So note to self: Remove all instances of console.log() prior to deploying or before testing on Internet Explorer.</p>
