<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> If Asset pipeline is configured according to production recommendations (config.assets.debug = false and config.assets.compress = true) then all the stylesheets from your manifest file will be concatenated without adding a newline between them. This may break your styling when you deploy to production.</p>
<p>I have been putting the finishing touches on the next version of <a href="http://www.brandregard.com">Brand Regard</a> for the last couple of weeks and have reached a stage where I wanted feedback from the non-programmers in the team. So I deployed the app to a staging environment. Imagine my surprise when the staging version did not look anything like what appeared when I ran the app locally.</p>
<p>After reviewing a lot of diffs, deployment configs etc. I managed to narrow it down to one line in the environments configuration. Namely,:

{% highlight ruby %}
config.assets.debug = true
{% endhighlight %}

<p>What this does is that it skips the Sprockets preprocessor and includes each file from the application.css manifest file, rather than combining them into a single file. After playing around with this a bit I finally found the real problem.</p>
<p>Many of the CSS files included in the manifest, did not end with a blank newline. But when the asset pipeline preprocessor combines them, it compresses all whitespace (and does not include any whitespace).</p>
<p>To illustrate why this is a problem, consider these two stylesheets:</p>
{% highlight css %}
.style1 { stuff; }
{% endhighlight %}
and
{% highlight css %}
.style2 { otherstuff; }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>If these files contain no trailing newlines, the combined stylesheet will (with compression turned on) look like this:
{% highlight css %}
.style1{stuff;}.style2{otherstuff;}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>But what you probably want is this:
{% highlight css %}
.style1{stuff;}
.style2{otherstuff;}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>So, to make sure that your websites looks the same regardless of the config.assets.debug setting, please add a trailing newline to each of your stylesheets.</p>
